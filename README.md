# NOTICE
If you're trying to use this before UI Expansion has updated (probably anything pre May 2025), make sure to also download [this replacement DLL](https://github.com/Petethegoat/off-the-map/raw/b06aa8bb08280e9aab3cd8d3ad20ef4391596c30/Data%20Files/MWSE/lib/uiexp_map_extension.dll) and replace the UI Expansion DLL in `Data Files/MWSE/lib`.
